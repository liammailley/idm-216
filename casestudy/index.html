     <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
     <p>
          For the IDM 216 class, I was tasked with taking the wireframes and ideas put forward in IDM 215 and developing them into a full-fledged, working application.
          Working with a group of 4 other studens, we decided to take on the development of Happy Sunshine's food truck app.
          <br>
          My position was <b>Data Architect</b>, meaning I focused on organizing and providing all required files and images, and kept the Teams organized and sorted.
     </p>
     <h1>CONTEXT AND CHALLENGE</h1>
     <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
     <p>
          In IDM 215, two wireframes (created by the teams of Quinn and Steven, members in my group) had already been created for the Happy Sunshine app. We used these as jumping-off points to develop a working prototype.
     </p>
     <a href="files/IDM215-HappySunshine-CaseStudy.pdf" class="betalink">Quinn's team's case study</a>
     <a href="files/IDM215-HappySunshine-FinalPresentation.pptx" class="betalink">Steven's team's case study</a>
     <p>
          We chose to mostly use Quinn's team's design, but borrowed inspiration from all iterations.
     </p>
     <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
     <p>
          The wireframe prototype had grand ideas, but ones that would be difficult to accomplish.
          <br><br>
          While the general look and feel of the app was relatively complete, it was the way that systems such as the customization screen would work that would define our team's efforts.
     </p>
     <h2>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</h2>
     <p>
          Our goal, broadly, was to translate a wireframe into a prototype. To do this, we needed to establish database connections, solve unforseen usability issues, and test for bugs wih the ordering system.
          <br><br>
          As Data Architect, my job was the support the Coders and Designers by supplying images and files when needed, and keeping the file structure neat and navigable so that our workspace didn't become overwhelming.
     </p>
     <h1>PROCESS AND INSIGHT</h1>
     <p>
          We used Microsoft Teams as a primary mode of communication. Quickly, it became apparent that our communication would benefit from organization.
     </p>
     <div class="image_box">
          <img class="gif" src="images/teams_tabs.png">
     </div>
     <p>
          I began by organizing the teams into 5 main tabs.
          Posts would cover communication, Files would hold the team's files;
          Tasks would cover self-assigned tasks;
          the Wiki would include all important team information;
          and the Links tab included any other important links for team use.
          <br><br>
          Next, I organized the team's file structure.
     </p>
     <div class="image_box">
          <img class="gif" src="images/teams_files.png">
     </div>
     <p>
          My intention was to make it very clear what each category contained, in order to help coders and designers pull in what they needed.
          The 215 folder contained all the materials from each team member's IDM 215 work;
          the Assets folder focused on the important logos and icons needed as a general part of the design;
          the Docs folder contained word documents and PDFs, as well as our database sheet;
          the Images folder contained all general images (such as backgrounds and customize pictures);
          the Page-Designs folder contained images of our project page;
          the Videos folder contained all videos;
          and the Wireframes folder contained all wireframe files and assets.
          <br><br>
          I made the concious decision to occasionally allow for the same file to exist in 2 different folder. For instance, some logos exist both in Assets and Images. This is to make it easier for my teammates to find what they need, and was intentional.
     </p>

     <p>
          Finally, I created a database sheet to allow for easy updating of the PHP database.
     </p>
     <div class="image_box">
          <img class="gif" src="images/database_customization.png">
     </div>
     <p>
          This Google Sheet would dynamically update the database, located on PHPMyAdmin. Working with the coders, I filled out the necessary variables to make the customize pages work...
     </p>
     <div class="image_box">
          <img class="gif" src="images/database_menu.png">
     </div>
     <p>
          ...as well as the general menu.
     </p>

     <h1>THE RESULTS</h1>
          <p>
          This project was a huge amount of work for the whole team, and it wouldn't have been possible if we had been any less organized.
          I'm proud to say that the organization of the Teams allowed for a fast and simple workflow for the designers.
          Moreover, database integration was absolutely critical for this project, and I was able to assist with this through my database work.
